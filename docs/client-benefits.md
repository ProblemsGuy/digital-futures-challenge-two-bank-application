# Client Benefits and Software usage 

The software being developed here will be useful tool for the bank to use. 

- Client Benefits:
For the client this software will provide easily read and accessible data about what transactions are performed at what dates. The information will be easy to load to spreadsheets and break down for analysis, allowing a break down of money in and money out to see an overall trend of transaction data, rather than the simple raw data of the balance itself. This will also give personalized data respective to each account holder, rather than mixing data between all account holders at once.

- End User benefits: 
For the end user, this software provides a direct way to interact with their banking information. Information is visibly displayed in a way the end user can see and understand, which makes their banking less opaque and allows them more useful information to engage with their money. By having access to an overdraft as well, the end user is able to take out more money than they would normally use, and give them more flexibility in purchasing and use of their money.
